Things that must installed at a system level:
 * gcc and gfortran (or another C and Fortran compiler)
 * Python 2.7
 * Python headers
 * virtualenv (could easily be installed manually though)

Recommended:
 * linear-algebra package including devel (in order of preference: MKL, ATLAS+LAPACK, OpenBLAS+LAPACK, any BLAS library)
 * devel packages for image formats you wish to read:
	* PNG: zlib (note: uncompressed always available)
	* TIFF: libtiff (note: uncompressed always available)
	* JPEG: libjpeg or libjpeg-turbo
	* JPEG2000: openjpeg
	* WebP: libwebp
	* tkinter bitmap/photos: tcl/tk
 * hdf5 devel package for reading and writing modern MATLAB files
 * fftw devel package for faster FFT calculations

So on CentOS-7 all of these can be installed with the following yum.
The following command installs all of them (including recommended, but not including some image formats):
	yum install gcc gcc-gfortran python python-devel python-virtualenv \
				atlas atlas-devel lapack lapack-devel lapack64 lapack64-devel \
				zlib zlib-devel libtiff libtiff-devel libjpeg-turbo libjpeg-turbo-devel \
				hdf5 hdf5-devel fftw fftw-devel

				
Now run these commands:

cd ~               # or wherever
mkdir imstack-env
cd imstack-env
virtualenv .
source bin/activate
pip install numpy
pip install cython # make sure this is installed before scipy and after numpy!
pip install scipy
pip install pillow, psutil, subprocess32
pip install h5py, pyfftw # only if the corresponding devel packages are installed
git clone git@github.com:slash-segmentation/segtools.git
ln -s segtools/pysegtools/imstack bin/imstack
imstack --check



Note that you can also use pip for many of these steps:

pip install[OPT,PIL,MATLAB,tasks]

Where OPT forces cython and fftw to be installed (for optimum performance), PIL forces PIL to be
installed, MATLAB forces h5py to be intsalled, and tasks forces psutil to be installed. Note that
these cannot force the installation of system devel packages, but may fail if those packages are
not installed. One MAJOR exception is that PIP will install just fine without support for PNGs,
TIFFs, JPEGs, etc if those devel libraries are not intsalled first!

Additionally, pip will not handle the last 2 steps - you must add these if desired.
